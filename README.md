# TCSS-Assignment-4
This was an assignment for a data structures course were we had to create a word counter for large text files using both tree and hash maps. I did the extra credit and did a GUI and I believe it came out very well. Purpose of the assignment was to understand how to use the two maps and not processing text, meaning the program is not perfect at counting all text files.
